## 2. Observer simulations with linear systems (section 3.2 of thesis report)

The files for these simulations are in the [`linear-sims`](linear-sims) sub-directory.  Navigate to this directory and then follow the instructions below.


### System models

The two systems considered are defined in the following files
 - [linear-sims/sys_rodin_step.m](linear-sims/sys_rodin_step.m) - SISO linear system described in section 3.2.1 and used in the simulations in section 3.2.2
 - [linear-sims/sys_rodin_step_2x2sym2.m](linear-sims/sys_rodin_step_2x2sym2.m) - 2x2 linear system used in section 3.2.3


### Process observers

### Observer parameter tuning experiments with SISO linear system (section 3.2.2)

The observer parameters were chosen by running multiple simulations with different combinations of parameter values.  Run the following scripts in the sequence shown to generate the latex for the summary tables of observer parameter search results.  Note: these simulations can take a long time to run.

### Plots

To make the various plots of the simulation results in section 3.2.2, run the following script, with the line `sim_name = "rod_obs_sim1_all_seed";` uncommented.

Also uncomment one of the lines in the section `choose observers to include in plots` to determine which observer results to include int he plots.  For example, to make the box plot in Figure 3.20, use the following:'
```lang-matlab
obs_sel_labels = {'KF3', 'MKF_SF95', 'MKF_SF1', 'MKF_SP1', 'SKF'};
```

To produce the plot 'Effect of random variables on the RMSE results=' in Fig. A.2 in the Appendix, run the following in sequence:
 - [linear-sims/gen_sim_specs_sim1_3KF_seed.m](linear-sims/gen_sim_specs_sim1_3KF_seed.m)
 - [linear-sims/run_obs_sims.m](linear-sims/run_obs_sims.m) with the line `sim_name = "rod_obs_sim1_3KF_seed";` uncommented
 - [linear-sims/rod_obs_sim_crmse_plot.m](linear-sims/rod_obs_sim_crmse_plot.m)


## 3. Observer simulations with grinding process simulator (section 3.3 of thesis report)

The files for these simulations are in the [`grind-sims`](grind-sims) sub-directory.  Navigate to this directory and then follow the instructions below.


### Data from grinding simulation model

The grinding simulation model used in these simulations is not included.  Instead, input-output data from simulations with this model is saved in the following directory:

The [data](data) subdirectory contains time-series data sets from 15 simulations of a grinding process model (the model itself is not available here).  Data sets 1 to 5 contain short simulations of 300 time steps.  Simulations 6 to 15 contain longer simulations of 2460 time steps.  The files contain data for 7 process variables although only two were used in this work (BASE_ORE_MIX and SAG_OF_P80_M).

| #  | Filename                                    | Use          |
| -- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |

| 2  | sim_OL_rc_est_mix_factor_300_2_ident.csv    | Process model validation (model selection)    |
| 3  | sim_OL_rc_est_mix_factor_300_3_ident.csv    | Initial observer test (Fig. 5 in paper)    |
| 4  | sim_OL_rc_est_mix_factor_300_4_ident.csv    | Not used     |
| 5  | sim_OL_rc_est_mix_factor_300_5_ident.csv    | Observer parameter optimization     |
| 6 ... 15  | sim_OL_rc_est_mix_factor_2460_6_ident.csv ... sim_OL_rc_est_mix_factor_2460_15_ident.csv  | Observer evaluation (RMSE results in Table 2 and Fig. 6 in paper)    |


### Process observers

 - [grind-sims/rod_obs_P2DcTd4.m](grind-sims/rod_obs_P2DcTd4.m) - observers with the identified linear system model and optimized parameters used for the grinding simulations in section 3.2.3.
 - [grind-sims/rod_obs_P2Dcd1_T.m](grind-sims/rod_obs_P2Dcd1_T.m) - these observers have a system model identified from simulation data without measurement nosie. This model provides better predictions of the true simulation outputs than the model identified from noisy measurements. However, results using these observers were not included in the thesis results.


### Instructions to reproduce the results

Open the script [rod_obs_sim.m](rod_obs_sim.m) and specify the input data sequences to include in the simulations in lines 55-57.  For example, specify the first 5 as follows:

```lang-matlab
i_in_seqs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

To change which observers are included in the simulations, edit line 82:

```lang-matlab
observers = {KF1, KF2, KF3, MKF_SF95, MKF_SF1, MKF_SP1, SKF};
```

The observers are defined in separate script files.

Running [rod_obs_sim.m](rod_obs_sim.m) with the above settings should produce the following output:

- rod_obs_sim_1_summary.csv

Explanation of output results files:
- The files 'rod_obs_sim_1_1.csv', 'rod_obs_sim_1_2.csv', ... etc. contain the state estimates, output estimates and output estimation errors of each observer for the duration of each simulation.
- The files 'rod_obs_sim_1_1_MMKF.csv', 'rod_obs_sim_1_2_MMKF.csv', ... etc. contain additional data on the multi-model observer (MMKF), such as the state estimates and conditional probabilities of each of the observer's Kalman filters.
- The file 'rod_obs_sim_1_resps.csv' contains the data used to create the plot of observer responses to shocks (Fig. 6 in the paper)
- The file 'rod_obs_sim_1_summary.csv' will contain a records of all the simulation parameters, model parameters, observer parameters, and overall RMSE metrics for each simualtion. This file is not over-written by 'rod_obs_sim.m'. Every time a new simulation is run, a new row is added to 'rod_obs_sim_1_summary.csv'. ***Before re-running simulations, remove the previous results from this file or erase it completely, otherwise, some results may be duplicated.***


### Plots

To produce the plots shown in the report, run simulations for all the datasets (1 to 15) and then run the scripts [rod_obs_sim_plots.m](rod_obs_sim_plots.m) and [rod_obs_step_plots.m](rod_obs_step_plots.m).

After running these scripts, images of the plot figures will be saved in the [plots](plots) folder in pdf format:

- rod_obs_sim_1_ioplot.pdf
- rod_obs_sim_3_est.pdf
- rod_obs_sim_resp_plot1.pdf
- rod_obs_sim_resp_plot2.pdf


### Evaluation metrics

To calculate the evaluation metrics in Table 3.8 of the thesis report, run the script [rod_obs_calc_metrics.m](rod_obs_calc_metrics.m).  This should produce the following output:

```lang-none

### Sensitivity analysis

To run the simulations for the sensitivity analysis in section 3.3.4, run the following script:

```lang-matlab
rod_obs_sim_sens_P2DcTd4
```

There is also a script to run the sensitivity analysis with observers that have the improved system model, but these results were not included in the thesis as they were not significantly different:

```lang-matlab
rod_obs_sim_sens_P2Dcd1_T
```

To produce the heat-map plots in figures 3.33 and 3.34, run the following Python notebook:
 - [grind-sims/Heatmap-plots-of-sensitivity-results.ipynb](grind-sims/Heatmap-plots-of-sensitivity-results.ipynb)


## Unit tests

A set of test scripts are included in each of the main sub-directories, to verify that the main sub-routines are working correctly.  To run the tests run the following command from each sub-directory of the main repository.

```lang-matlab
runtests
```
